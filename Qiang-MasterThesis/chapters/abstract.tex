Influence maximization is the problem of selecting $k$ nodes in a social network to maximize their influence spread.
The problem has been extensively studied but most work focuses on the submodular influence diffusion models.
In this paper, motivated by empirical evidences, we explore influence maximization in the non-submodular regime.
In particular, we study the general threshold model in which a fraction of nodes have non-submodular threshold
	functions, but their threshold functions are closely upper- and lower-bounded by some submodular
	functions (we call them $\varepsilon$-almost submodular).
We first show a strong hardness result: there is no $1/n^{\frac{\gamma}{c}}$ approximation for influence maximization (unless P = NP)
	for all networks with up to $n^{\gamma}$ $\varepsilon$-almost submodular nodes, where $\gamma$ in $(0,1)$ 
	and $c$ is parameter depending on $\varepsilon$.
We then provide constant approximation algorithms when the number of non-submodular nodes are constant.
Finally, we conduct experiments on a number of real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that our approximation algorithms
	outperform other benchmark algorithms.
